                        <p>My ideal job is the product manager of a game. The main role of the job is to work with a
                            team to manage a game
                            resources and direction. Moreover,

                            be creative with my work without a lot of constraints. Moreover, it is usually a high paid
                            position and I could manage my own working schedule.</p>

                            years of experiences. For this specific company, they are looking for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A BA/BS in computer science, business administration or equivalent</li>
                            <li>Have already made at least a whole project through complete development cycle</li>
                            <li>Have managed and growth a live product (game)</li>
                            <li>Have excellent communication, organization and leadership skills</li>

                            normal for me not to have any qualifications or enough soft skills for the job. For the BS
                            qualification, I will need to finish my degree at RMIT and maybe take an extra course in
                            product management. Moreover, I must get an internship or an entry level job (like game
                            function developer) to build up my working experience and soft skills like communication in
                            a team for a couple of years.

                                Most of results of the test was not very surprising to me except for the learning style
                                one. I
                                have taken the learning style test before and it was a tie between auditory and visual
                                style.
                                Additionally, the results do somewhat reflect what my usual role in a team, which is

                                between members and the technical one in a team. When choosing team members, I often
                                chose
                                members that are opposite or compliment my personality (like extrovert) to take on
                                different
                                roles that I am not good at. Moreover, since my highest personality trait is openness, I

                                get along well with most people.

                <h2 class="mb-3">Project Idea</h2>
                <p>My ideal job is to become a game creator, so I am interested in AI and gaming overall. AI or bot has
                    always played a vital part in early video game days. Moreover, with the rising of data science and
                    the need for AI in the industry, many companies are looking for developers with some experience in
                    this field. Because of that, I want to develop a bot that can win the game “2048”. The bot (or AI)
                    will not be too complicated to develop since the rule are simple, and it will be a good beginner AI
                    project. Furthermore, this project will help me gain experience and help me learn the life cycle of
                    a project.</p>
                <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-center mb-5">
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/2048.jpg" alt="2048">
                </div>
                <p class="mb-1">The goal of the game is to add the number up to 2048 by sliding the tiles with the same
                    value together. And each time the player swipe to slide, a new tile will appear in one of the empty
                    16 spaces. The AI that I am going to develop will be able to win the game (get to 2048) in a certain
                    amount of time by calculating its next move. There are several ways we can achieve this goal.</p>
                <ol class="mb-4">
                    <li>We let the computer enumerate random move and choose the path that has the highest score.</li>
                    <li>We can use an algorithm name minimax (usually used in chess games).</li>
                    <li>We can also use a variation of the minimax algorithm call expectimax algorithm to make the bot.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    For the first method, it is quite straight forward, but the computer memories are limited. We could
                    store the data of each move iteration as nodes in a tree structure and choose the path that leads to
                    the highest score. The bot will try to move upward (1 node) than downward (1 node) then record this
                    its total score. Similarly, the bot will try to move upward then left (or right) again then record
                    the path score. After the bot finished all the possible moves (depth limited by the user), it will
                    then choose the path with the highest score and follow it until the game is finish. However, this
                    method has some problems, like the number of memories that will be used when the bot will use to
                    store the game board state. Moreover, this method would not guarantee a 100% success rate since it
                    imitates human logic without any optimal decision making.

                    For the second and third solution, from my current understanding, the algorithm tries all possible
                    moves, then backtracks and make the decision. The algorithm will store all the states of the game
                    board in the tree data structure as a node. Each node will have a calculated score base on the rule
                    provided by the developer. The goal of the algorithm is to choose an optimal move while minimizing
                    the possible loss for the player by comparing the score in each node. What differs from the first
                    method is that this algorithm is a well-developed and is based on a strategy in decision theory.
                    Moreover, this kind of algorithm has used in many two-players turn base games before such as
                    tic-tac-toe and chess.

                    For implementing the bot, I would first need to be able to run the game. The software I will be
                    using to run the game (or recreate it) is an IDE or Unity. Since the game is quite old at this
                    point, there should be some game clone on GitHub. Moreover, because the Minimax algorithm has been
                    developed for a long time, there are many documentations about the algorithm on the internet like
                    <a
                        href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/"><i>geeksforgeeks.org</i></a>.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    For the skills requirement, I would also need some knowledge about tree structure and how to
                    traverse them with a different algorithm. It would take some time to learn all the required
                    knowledge, but it could be found on the internet or in some later RMIT courses. Furthermore, to
                    develop and understand the code of the game and implement the bot, I would also need to learn about
                    object-oriented programming.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The main outcome of this project is that I would gain some knowledge of how to build a functioning
                    AI and how to implement it. The project is successful when the bot can win the game with the success
                    rate over (or at least 90%) of the time it is active. One potential function for the bot is the hint
                    function for this game. Moreover, the Minimax algorithm is versatile and can be easily modify for
                    other purposes
                    from engineering to business.
